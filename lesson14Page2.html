    The American Motors Coperation Javelin
    <h1>Some like it for what it is. Others like it for what it can be.</h1><br>

    <p> The AMC Javelin is an American front-engine, rear-wheel-drive, two-door hardtop automobile manufactured and marketed by American Motors Corporation (AMC) across two generations, 1968–1970 and 1971–1974 model years.

      Styled by Dick Teague, the Javelin was available in a range of trim and engine levels, from economical pony car to muscle car variants.[2] In addition to manufacture in Kenosha, Wisconsin, Javelins were assembled under license in Germany, Mexico, Philippines, Venezuela, as well as Australia – and were marketed globally.
      
      As the winner of Trans-Am race series in 1971, 1972, and 1976, the second-generation AMX variant was the first pony car to be used as a standard vehicle for highway police car duties by an American law enforcement agency. - Wkipedia</p>
