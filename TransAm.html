            <h1>In 1968 the American Motors Coperation took a leap of faith with the Javelin. This fun, sporty car was a huge shift from the boring and fuel effiecnt cars AMC had been producing. With this shift came something no one expected. AMC entered in the 1968 Trans Am season. The scrappy little Javelin would be put to the test against rival Mustangs and Camaros. Amazingly the Javelins did well. Even more surprising they started to win. Then in 1971 a Javelin driven by Mark Donohue caputured the Trans Am championship. Then another Javelin championship in 1972. A new unexpected rivalry had been created by the hard racing. Mustang vs Javelin. The Javelin got it's final championship in 1976. An amazing 2 years after the Javelin had been discontiuned.  </h1>
