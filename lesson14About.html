            <h1>    The AMC Javelin was American Motors attempt to break into the muscle and pony car market. Debuting in 1968 the Javelin instantly became a classic. With muscle car looks, courtesy of Dick Teague, and pony car size it was the best of both worlds. The Javelin would recieve a complete styling overhual in 1971. With new buldging fenders and a long front nose it was easily able to out class the big three in looks. In 1972 it would get the AMX package giving it better handeling and even more power. However in 1974 the Javelin name was retired and there hasn't been a new one since.</h1>
